Understanding what has been done in the literature, and how to cite it in technical writing is an important skill. You should perform a literature search relevant to your project, and prepare a summary document of what you find. This document should cover 5-10 papers/books with a paragraph on each reference that briefly summarizes the reference. Make sure to create a bibtex file with the references in them, and use cite links in this document.

See elisp:org-ref-help for some help on citations and references.

*** TODO Project outline

You should prepare a written document that outlines your plans for your project and what you want to accomplish in the spring semester.

This document does not need to be long, but it needs to be helpful.
